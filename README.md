[Podcast 311: How to think in React](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/02/09/podcast-311-how-to-think-in-react/)  

## Some thoughts
This course teaches you to build a *reusable* and *declarative* **React** component library.  
It's *perfect* for developers who are looking to build a **scalable design system** for their team and product.

## Comment from Carrie Ba (zb631) 
From many computer science course that I have been taken already, I see how React is being a pretty useful tool. Something interesting about this podcast is that how it provide us a different point of view of how we should think in React. "a reusable and declarative React" is defenitely some thing that we need to keep in mind for sustainable development in system design.

Thanks for your comment Carrie.

It is a very concise while informative podcast. I found it interesting that how the guest, Cassidy Williams, talked so mamy details within just 30 minutes. It really makes me looking forward to learning React in this semester.
